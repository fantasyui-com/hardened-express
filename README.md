# hardened-express
Fast, opinionated, hardened web framework.

## Key Points
Limitations, there will be limitations imposed by security, and some things will be discouraged.

User must be able to replace ```const express = require("express");``` with ```const express = require("hardened-express");``` and expect most of the safe things to work.

## TODO
HTTPS via https://letsencrypt.org
